# Design decisions

This file records the measured decisions behind the build. The design itself
is in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-22-rgi-mirror-design.md`.

## The catalog is generated

The template expects a hand-edited `catalog/`. This repository generates it.
`pixi run python -m rgi_catalog render` writes `catalog/` from the tracked
files in `metadata/`. A unit test fails when `catalog/` differs from a fresh
render. Edit `metadata/`, never `catalog/`.

## GeoParquet writer

`src/rgi_catalog/geoparquet.py` writes each file in two steps:

1. geopandas writes a plain intermediate GeoParquet file. Its schema
   metadata carries the key-value metadata (`rgi:version`,
   `rgi:mirror_revision`, `rgi:sources`, `rgi:citation`, `rgi:catalog`).
2. The gpio Python API reads that file, adds the bbox covering column,
   orders the rows on the Hilbert curve, and writes the published file in
   one pass. The settings are GeoParquet 2.0, zstd level 15, and the chosen
   row group size. gpio carries the input's non-geo key-value metadata into
   the output (geoparquet-io #690).

gpio does not repair geometries on this path. The build repairs geometries
itself and reports each repair.

The write uses gpio's `in-memory` strategy, which writes through pyarrow.
gpio's default strategy writes through DuckDB, which made row groups of up
to 12,122 rows on the full glaciers table when 10,240 were requested. The
pyarrow writer keeps the size exactly. Its file is 321.7 MB against 293.6 MB
from DuckDB at the same zstd level. The writer refuses a file whose row
groups exceed the requested size.

gpio writes whole 2,048-row vectors, so a requested size is rounded up to a
multiple of 2,048.

### Byte stability

Two writes of the same table give identical bytes.
`tests/unit/test_geoparquet.py::test_write_geoparquet_is_deterministic`
checks this on a 5,000-row table with list and struct columns.

### Readers

`scripts/check_readers.py PATH` reads a file with DuckDB (spatial extension,
a bbox query), geopandas, GDAL through pyogrio, and `gpio check all`. GDAL
needs its Parquet driver, which conda-forge ships as `libgdal-arrow-parquet`.
The pixi environment installs it.

## Glaciers file (measured 2026-10-22)

`convert --products glaciers` writes 274,531 rows. The measurements below
were taken with gpio's default DuckDB writer, before the switch to the
pyarrow writer. At gpio's default of 49,152 rows per group the file was
293.6 MB in 6 row groups.

Readers on the GeoParquet 2.0 file:

| Reader | Result |
| --- | --- |
| DuckDB 1.5.6, spatial bbox query | ok |
| geopandas 1.2.0 | ok, 274,531 rows |
| GDAL 3.13.3 (pyogrio) | ok, 274,531 features |
| `gpio check all` | ok, 40 spec checks passed |

### Row group size

`scripts/check_readers.py --measure` rewrites the file at four sizes and
serves each from a local Range server. The scan is
`SELECT avg(area_km2)` (median of 3 runs, fresh connection each). The
one-glacier read is a bbox query for the first glacier's `cenlon`/`cenlat`.

| Rows per group | Row groups | File MB | Scan s | Scan MB | Scan requests | One glacier MB | One glacier requests |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 10,000 | 27 | 294.6 | 1.071 | 2.61 | 29 | 14.28 | 7 |
| 25,000 | 11 | 292.7 | 1.026 | 2.61 | 13 | 25.03 | 7 |
| 50,000 | 6 | 293.6 | 0.011 | 2.61 | 8 | 61.52 | 7 |
| 100,000 | 3 | 292.9 | 0.010 | 2.61 | 5 | 119.82 | 7 |

The scan reads the same 2.61 MB at every size. Its time steps from about
0.01 s to about 1 s between 8 and 13 requests. That step comes from the
local server or DuckDB's HTTP client, not from the bytes read. On a remote
host each request adds round-trip latency instead.

The one-glacier read fetches the whole geometry column chunk of the matching
row group. Its size grows in proportion to the row group size.

**Decision (author, 2026-10-22): 10,000 rows per group, written as
10,240.** The later viewer fetches single glaciers, and this size makes that
read about 4 times cheaper than 50,000. The cost is about 20 more requests
per full scan. The size is below the 50,000 to 150,000 range that the
distribution guide recommends. rashid runs against the data in Task 11.

The final glaciers file has 27 row groups of at most 10,240 rows, 321.7 MB.
The build takes 2 min 27 s and peaks at 5.9 GB of memory.
